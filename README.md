#  Esi4611 - Group 10 - PlantTraits2024 Prediction Challenge

Welcome to the PlantTraits2024 Challenge repository! This project is part of the FGVC11 workshop at CVPR 2024, aiming to advance our understanding of global patterns of biodiversity through the prediction of plant traits using image data and ancillary information.

## Competition Details

The PlantTraits2024 Challenge is hosted on Kaggle. You can find the competition page [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/planttraits2024). The challenge involves predicting a diverse set of 6 plant traits, such as leaf area and plant height, from crowd-sourced plant images and supplementary data.

## Contributors

This project is developed and maintained by a group of students from the University of Florida enrolled in the Esi4611 - Advanced Data Analytics course:

- Brett Burton
- Emma Lowman
- Jackson Tyndall

## Goal

Our primary objective is to employ convolutional neural network (CNN) models to accurately predict plant traits based on the provided images and accompanying data.
